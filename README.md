# template-flutter-vue-python
!!These templates are not ready!!
Some things are messy cause It's still a work in progress, I'm currently improving the features and the code

This is a configured template I made for future projects

  Password security with Werkzeug -> generate_password_hash from werkzeug.security
  JWT
  CORS
  Layered architecture
  ORM with working models -> SQLAlchemy
  Classes
  Migrations -> Flask-Migrate
  Separate file for routes
  Separate file for some server configurations
  Dotenv
  Black formatter

Frontend Features (Vue.js(JavaScript)):
  Nothing yet

Mobile Features (Flutter(Dart)):
  Conection with api
  Dotenv
  Google fonts
  Screens: Login and Register
  Routing
  DefaultTabController shown on authenticated
  Custom widgets
  All used colors exported on a separate file (better to deal with possible changes and its easier to see which colors we are using around the app)
